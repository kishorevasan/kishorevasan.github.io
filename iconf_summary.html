                    <p class = "mb-30">Personal identity defines us; professional identity defines our community. Identity management is very crucial not only to define our community but also to have a sense of personal belonging. With the ambiguity and broad definitions of the field of information science, the band of information enthusiasts face an identity crisis - who are we? As we move into the information age, several fields like geography, oceanic sciences and sociology equip their graduates to realize the importance of information. In many schools, the undergraduate curriculm now require students to take technical courses and learn to mine massive datasets. The issue at hand is as stands - how do we differentiate the cohort of information science (informatics) students from the students of other disciplines who perform scientific work based on information? </p>

                    <p class="mb-30"> As a student of the information science program, I had the opportunity to attend the 14th Information Schools Conference <a href="https://ischools.org/the-iconference/about-the-iconference/iconference-preview/" target="blank">(iConference)</a>. The conference is organized and primarily consists of Information Schools across the world and is aimed to act as a platform to further research in the information science discipline. The event this year took place in Washington DC from March 31 â€“ April 3. I also presented my work titled <b>"Measuring Scientific Buzz"</b> as a poster at the conference. The poster session this year saw posters with a multitude of themes ranging from science of science to accountability of artificial intelligence systems. The main theme of discussion throughout the conference - in panels and coffee breaks - revolved around the definition of the field of information science. In this blog post, I take my insights from attending the conference and attempt to untangle the identity crisis among information scientists.  </p>

                    <blockquote>Overheard at the conference: "When I tell my fellow passenger that I am an information scientist, it is either a conversation starter or a conversation stopper because the other person doesn't understamd what that means."</blockquote>

                    <p class = "mb-30"> Information science research broadly falls into three domains - information organization, information retrieval, and information visualization. These domains have several underlying themes ranging from accessibility to human computer interaction. It is complicated to clearly identify sub fields of study primarily because the ideas coexist and overlaps with multiple topics. For example, the accessibility research is part of web development when talking about accessibility in the online space but takes shape as a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) challenge when dealing with wearable technology. While this creates unclear lines of research, I believe this is an advantage, as now we have researchers from different domains looking to solve the same set of issues with different facets or methods of research.

                    <p class = "mb-30">Evolution of a field is not an uncommon phenomenon. Every domain, sub-domain and even topics experiences transitions and shifts in the primary area of focus. It creates confusion in case of Information Science as a research paper could be viewed to contribute to multiple topics. I will explain this by using the example of the field of science of science. The field analyzes large scale scholarly data to improve how science is done. Early on this area was referred to as 'bibliometrics', which originated from library sciences looking at raw counts of publications and citations. But as data science started to boom, the field took shape as a machine learning area of study and is now referred to as 'scientometrics'. So now, will Information Science remain in the realm of bibliometrics or move into the sphere of scientometrics? </p>

                    <p class = "mb-30"> Evolution of the topic is the after effect of dynamic changes due to scientific trends. Every minor reword appears to affect the broader definiton of the field when infact, the topic is going through its natural course of evolution. The structural and thematic changes of the sub-domains should not affect the definitions of Information Science. We should be aware of these changes and accept them into the broad umbrella of study. We should support and embrace these thematic complexity. The key to furthering the community is not in limiting and defining our boundaries but in adapting to the development.</p>

                    <blockquote>Statement by a panelist: "Information scientists created Google. The famous page-rank algorithm underlying the search engine is deep rooted in the dynamic processes of citation networks- which stems from information flow in networks."</blockquote>

                    <p class = "mb-30"> Having understand the state of sub-fields in the information science space, how do we define our topic of focus with respect to the broader field of study? The beauty of this field is that it wraps around your area of focus. The key features however should incorporate ideas of people, technology and diversity in a cautious way. This is where the breadth of study and the thin lines of definition shows its true power. When you provide a platform for multiple ideas coming together and the ability for researchers to create their own field of study, great things can happen.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30"> Now, we defined the topics of study, and the individual area of focus but in the larger context what is the role of an information scientist? The role of an information scientist is slightly different from that of a computer scientist - a computer scientist primarily attempts to further the theoretical and technical devlopment of technology. <b><i> An information scientist uses data, technology, and methods to works to interpret and contextualize the information based on people and their experiences.</i></b> In no way are the roles of the two positions in society exclusive. The two fields experience a large overlap and coexist in the domain of scientific research. </p>

                     <blockquote>There are very few fields that take the lines of technology, people and diversity as seriously as information science does.</blockquote>


                    <p class = "mb-30"> Every field of study has their challenges. If you talk to comparitive literature students, they would complain about the lack of recognition. If you approach historians, they would whine about lack of popularity. We should not be envious of other fields but rather welcome the breadth of our field and adapt to changes. Most importantly, as information science researchers, we should be proud of our work and our field. As we can notice, this field has the power to disrupt the world wide web by pioneering Google! </p>

                    <p class = "mb-30"> Wow, this field of study sounds super interesting, where do I sign up? There is no set of pre-requisities or criteria you need to pass to become a member of the information enthusiasts community. The strength of the field lies in its wide area of focus. As a professional- in the industry or in academia- take the key ideas of data literacy, user privacy, and ethical implications from information science and use it to define your work as an information scientist. Be it a web developer or a product designer or a data analyst, you too can come under the blanket of the information school. The information science field can be yours if you want it to be! </p>
